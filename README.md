# hello-world
my first github repository
==========================

Hi humans,

wandererdmnc here. I'm trying to learn ruby and I signed up on github. Oh... wait. Why am I here again? xD

downloaded ruby from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
installed on computer
read readme.md through a browser

oh... there. I found a statement saying "if you're using git..."

am I doing the right thing here?

=========================
README edit #2

I didn't quite get the pull request instructions that's why I'm repeating the process.
